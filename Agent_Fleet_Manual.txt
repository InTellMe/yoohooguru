Cursor Agent Fleet: Operations Manual

Use these prompts in the Cursor Chat (Ctrl+L or Cmd+L) to deploy your agents.

🕵️ Phase 1: The Audit (The Surveyor)

Goal: Understand the mess before we fix it.
Prompt:

@Codebase Act as The Surveyor. Scan the repository structure.

List all distinct sub-projects or directories that look like subdomains.

Identify where the "LLM Assistants" code lives (look for OpenAI/Anthropic API calls or Python backend files).

Compare the current file structure against a standard Next.js/React structure and highlight major deviations or "messy" areas.

Generate a WORK_QUEUE.md file listing the top 10 architectural issues found.

🧹 Phase 2: The Cleanup (The Janitor)

Goal: Clear the noise so we can see the signal.
Prompt:

Act as The Janitor. Read the WORK_QUEUE.md created by The Surveyor.

Identify any "dead" files (files not imported anywhere).

Look for hardcoded API keys (warn me, do not delete yet).

Standardize the .env example files.

Wait for my permission before deleting or moving any files.

🔗 Phase 3: The Integration (The Connector)

Goal: Connect the landing page to the actual assistants.
Prompt:

Act as The Connector. I need to link the main landing page to my subdomains.

Analyze the routing file (likely next.config.js, middleware.ts, or routes.tsx).

Verify how tech.yoohoo.guru or other subdomains are handled.

Check the code for the LLM Assistants. Are they running as API routes or separate servers?

Propose a plan to unify the navigation bar so users can jump between the main site and the assistants.

💸 Phase 4: The Cash Flow (The Rainmaker)

Goal: Monetize nested subdomains and LLM interactions.
Prompt:

Act as The Rainmaker. Focus on Nested Subdomain Monetization.

Audit the subdomains for potential "paywalls" or "subscription gates" (e.g., separating free.tool from pro.tool).

Check how the LLM Assistants are costing us money (API usage) and propose a credit/token system.

Look for areas to inject affiliate links or ad-slots within the LLM responses without degrading user experience.

Draft a MONETIZATION_STRATEGY.md outlining specific nested routes to gatekeep.
